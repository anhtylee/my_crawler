"27,712",Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,,of $177k goal,510,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes
"674,496",British Gut,,,,,"This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The American Gut Project (AGP) / The Microsetta Initiative to expand the study of the bacterial diversity to
    participants in Europe. If you are a participant living outside Europe and would like
    to participate, please refer to our American Gut Fundrazr page . Many
  people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play an
  incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them:
  They make up 50 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"".  Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe, as an extension
    of the American Gut Project & The Microsetta Initiative, based
    at the University of California San Diego.  We have collaborated
    with TwinsUK at King’s College London so that those living in Europe
    can participate, and with your help, we will be able to discover
    more about the crucial relationship between our health and our
    microbiome, and on a personal level, you will be able to discover
    the bacterial profile of your own gut. With your help, we hope to be
    able to answer questions such as 'How much does our choice of
    lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and can we alter our
    microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has
    their own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out
    what constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of
    bacteria are beneficial and which ones should be avoided. In order
    to do this ambitious and much-needed project, we urgently need a
    large scale collection of human samples. Over ten thousand people
    have already signed up in America already through the American Gut
    Project-- but we need many more from Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main
    'microbial home', however, the study will also look at areas like
    the oral and skin, as these areas of the body may be influenced by
    the microbiome. Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the left-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” found
    on the right side (if you would like to receive a specific number of
    kits that isn’t listed as a perk, email us at info@britishgut.org ). You will receive your kit within 3 weeks after payment. Shipping within the U.K. first class should be around £2.90, but
    we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the proper
    postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is important
    since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely not
    produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your
    sample to us, we will then sent it to the Knight Lab at the
    University of California San Diego to be processed and analyzed. We estimate that the whole process will take about 4-5
  months. We typically bulk ship samples back to the Knight
  Lab every 1-2 months on dry ice to reduce shipping costs. Once your
  sample is arrives at the Knight Lab (you'll get a notification when
  they have received your sample), it takes approximately 3 months to
  return results. Each kit contains a sample collection device (or multiple if you
    ordered more than one), an instruction packet on how to sample, and
    return envelope(s) to send your sample tube(s) back. Once we provide you with your results, you will receive data
    visualization of how your results compare to other people who are
    within the same diet and lifestyle group as you (having different
    results from them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can
    just be that you have different lifestyles that make bacterial
    profile is different).   In addition, you will be provided with a
    list of the major groups of bacteria in your sample and their
    relative abundances (based at the genus level). These results are not actionable,
      and we do not provide any personalized interpretation . It will take longer than the expected 4-5 months to receive
      results if you are submitting one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples. A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome. Note your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the British Gut Project help
      account ( info@britishgut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the Fundrazr transaction fee will be
        deducted from your refund. The consent forms are maintained on the participant website;
      details are included in your kit. To sign the consent form, you

"1,570",Please Help Us With Dad's Pancreatic Cancer Chemo Costs,Euro,,of €37k goal,46,"A few weeks ago, my father, Florin, was diagnosed with stage 3
  pancreatic cancer at the head of the pancreas. For those who don’t
  know us, I’m Laura, I have a sister and a brother who’s 11 years old,
  so still only a young kid who doesn’t fully understand what is
  happening with our father’s health. We are all desperate and worried
  and have started this fundraising campaign to ask for your help and
  kindness, to be able to cover our father’s chemo treatment costs. We
  can’t even imagine living in a world where our father is no longer
  there and even writing this down makes my hands shake. For us all, this terrible news has come as a shock, we couldn’t
  believe something like this could happen to him. I saw him first on
  the 13th of February after my last visit home in October, and I felt a
  knot in my throat. He had just had a stent inserted to help with the
  jaundice and the tall, imposing, well build man I’ve always known him
  to be was then skinny and grey skinned. Since then, he’s looking much
  better, gained back a healthier color in his cheeks, he’s got a
  healthy appetite and he’s feeling hopeful and determined to get better. At the moment, the tumor they found is a huge 45 millimeters
  adenocarcinoma and is not operable. Thankfully, a chemo treatment
  available in Vienna could improve his life chances, hopefully
  shrinking the tumor down, making it operable. Last week, doctors
  advised treatment should start immediately as there is no more time to
  waste and the healthcare standard available in Vienna is the best
  available option for my dad’s prognosis. On the 1st of March, he
  started his first round of chemo with Abraxane and Gemzar. Each chemo
  session is charged at 3700 euros and the cost is estimated at around
  37.000 euros for the first few months of treatment. Right now, we’re
  taking it step by step, though in the near future, under the
  circumstances, we do not know how we will be able to afford treatment
  anymore. It’ s widely known that pancreatic cancer is one of the most
  aggressive types, but if anyone can come back from this, I know it’s
  our dad. He has always been a strong, optimistic man and continues to
  be so even under the circumstances. He is willing to do and try
  everything possible to fight this, but we do need help to see him
  through. Please, as far as possible, help us get there! Any donations
  can help us get closer to saving dad. We will forever be thankful and
  grateful for your kindness! .......................................................................................................................... Cu câteva săptămâni în urmă, tatal nostru, Florin Mateescu, a fost
  diagnosticat cu cancer pancreatic, stadiul 3 la cap de pancreas.
  Pentru cei ce nu ne cunosc, sunt Laura, am o soră și un frate care are
  11 ani,  încă un copil, care nu înțelege pe deplin ce se întâmplă cu
  sănătatea tatălui nostru. Suntem cu toții disperați și îngrijorați și
  am început această campanie de strângere de fonduri pentru a cere
  ajutorul vostru și a face apel bunătatii voastre, sa putem acoperi
  costurile de tratament pentru tata. Nici nu ne putem închipui să trăim
  într-o lume în care el nu mai este și numai scriind aceste randuri,
  imi tremura mainile. Pentru noi toți, această veste teribilă a venit ca un șoc, nici acum
  nu putem crede că așa ceva i se putea întâmpla lui. Pe 13 Februarie,
  prima dată când l-am văzut pe tata de la ultima mea vizită in Romania
  din Octombrie, am simțit un nod în gât. Tocmai ce ii pusesera un stent
  pentru a controla icterul, arata slab, cu pielea de o culoare cenusie.
  De atunci, se simte mult mai bine, are din nou o culoare sănătoasă în
  obraji, un apetit sănătos și se simte plin de speranță și hotărât să
  faca tot posibilul sa se insanatoseasca. Tumoarea pe care au descoperit-o este un adenocarcinom de 45 de
  milimetri și care, deocamdata nu este operabil. Din fericire, un
  tratament cu chimioterapie disponibil în Viena ar putea să-i
  îmbunătățească șansele de viață, sperând că o sa scadă tumoarea,
  devenind operabila. Săptămâna trecută, medicii au recomandat ca
  tratamentul să înceapă imediat, nu mai este timp de pierdut, iar
  standardul medical disponibil în Viena este cea mai bună opțiune
  disponibilă pentru tratarea tatălui meu. La 1 Martie, a început prima
  rundă de chimioterapie cu Abraxane și Gemzar. Fiecare sesiune de
  chimioterapie costa 3700 de euro, iar costul este estimat la
  aproximativ 37.000 de euro pentru primele luni de tratament. In
  momentul de fata, o luăm pas cu pas, deși în viitorul apropiat, în
  aceste circumstanțe, nu știm cum vom putea să ne permitem continuarea tratamentului. Dupa cum se bine stie, cancerul pancreatic este unul din tipurile
  cele mai agresive, dar dacă cineva poate reusi in lupta asta, știu că
  acea persoana e tată. El a fost întotdeauna un om puternic, optimist
  și continuă să fie la fel chiar si în aceste momente. Este dispus să
  facă și să încerce tot posibilul pentru a lupta împotriva acestui
  cancer, dar avem nevoie de sprijinul vostru. Vă rugăm, pe cat posibil,
  să ne ajutati, orice donație ne poate aduce mai aproape de a il salva
  pe tata. Va vom fi pentru totdeauna recunoscători pentru bunătatea voastră!",https://fundrazr.com/c1TAWc

  Rocio Garcia, and I have setup this Fundrazer page for my S/O
  (Significant Other/Fiance) Thomas Ernst.  (He is German so there is a
  summary in his language below this English text) For Mexican supporters: Find a summary in Spanish
    here - En español aqui He was hospitalized with a
  aggressive tissue decaying infection in his left leg below the knee
  December 2016 with the initial diagnoses by several doctors to
  amputate the leg above the knee. Dr. Mar Chavira at Salvatierra
  hospital in La Paz did not share that opinion and initiated treatment
  and procedures to rescue the limb and avoid an pending
  amputation. The goal of this fundraising..if met...would cover
  our medical expenses incurred so far (+/-9,500,-US $) as well the cost
  of living / debt accumulated during the time of the illness and
  recovery without any income and would supply the funding required to
  find another rental moving to a better location with option to work
  for him (+/- 5500,-US $) Please read explanation in details further
  down and in the blog we have started. Basically we are not capable on our own power to leave the
  sub-average lifestyle zone we are in right now and funding would
  provide a huge help to Thomas Ernst and me assisting to restart our
  life to a ""normal"", simple lifestyle level again. This
  is basically ""our story"" in a nutshell. Please read in
  detail below and may consider making a donation to allow T.E. to get
  back to work, to manage the significant debt accumulated from his
  battle with the infection. A donation of any kind will be greatly
  appreciated and would be a huge help. Also, please feel free to
  forward on the link to anyone you think might be interested in
  supporting the cause. Please use this contact form If you have
  any questions. Otherwise, thank you for your time and consideration of
  this effort to help Thomas Ernst and
  me. --------------------------------------------------- We
  do not have a professional background to create such fundraiser pages
  as this here in the proper way and writing. My English also has
  severe flaws and I apologize for that. It is work in progress as
  we been forced to change the fundraiser platform due to the
  circumstances that prior used crowdfund Youcaring merged with GoFundMe
  and by their policy is Mexico a Non-GoFundMe supported Country
    and they will shut down. You find info on this here You can see screenshots of received donations during the past 2
  weeks here on our blog . The prior campaign did not generate any support since put online June
  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at the Baja Nomads forum and made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space. Also here
  you find the progress in several sets of images from December 2016 on
  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!! Album - Gallery until August 2017 here on Google documents . We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the
  first 6 month 2-3x per week hospital visits), the cost of medication,
  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.
  Ernst Thomas has no family or relatives, Maria has a small income from
  a clerical position in a hotel working night-shifts. We have sold any valuables to create funds, we have no vehicle. Ernst
  Thomas was still recovering from the impact hurricane Norbert and
  Odile created 2014. ###################################################################### German Summary - E.T. ist jederzeit bereit mit Ihnen in Deutsch zu kommunizieren und evtl. Fragen zur

    Gewebeverfall-Infektion in seinem linken Bein unterhalb des Knies im
    Dezember 2016 ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert, wobei mehrere Ärzte
    zunächst das Bein über dem Knie amputierten wollten. Dr. Mar
    Chavira vom Salvatierra-Krankenhaus in La Paz teilte diese Meinung
    nicht und leitete eine Behandlung und Verfahren ein, um das Glied zu
    retten und eine bevorstehende Amputation zu vermeiden. Das Ziel
    dieser Spendenaktion - falls wir es erreichen koennten - wäre unsere
    bisher angefallenen Arztkosten (+/- 9.500, - US $) sowie die während
    der Zeit der Krankheit akkumulierten Lebenshaltungskosten /
    -schulden und die einkommenslose Genesungzeit zu tragen und eine
    Finanzierung bereitstellen, die benötigt wird, um eine andere
    Wohngelegenheit zu finden, die zu einem besseren Standort mit der
    Möglichkeit bewegt, für ihn zu arbeiten (+/- 5500,-US $). Grundsätzlich sind wir nicht in der Lage, die
    unterdurchschnittliche Lebenstil, in der wir uns gerade befinden,

"3,695",Toni For LIFE!,U.S. Dollar,"May 1, 2019",of $10k goal,30,"Just days before Christmas , Toni Williams recieved a diagnosis that
  was practically unheard of for a healthy, young, active wife and
  mother of 3.  At 41 years old,Toni was diagnosed with stage IV
  colorectal cancer that rapidly spread to other parts of her body. Only a few months prior, Toni was developing her best self, as well
  as hosting fitness and health related motivational groups promoting
  exercise and clean eating and encouraging others. She has always been
  active, motivated, selfless, hard working, and devoted to her family.
  All of this adding to the bewilderment of what was yet to come. Around August/September she started noticing something wasn't quite
  right. Being strong willed and stubborn as she is, her family
  convinced her to get checked out. Since November, Toni has been
  through doctor after doctor, countless appointments,  tests upon tests
  trying to find out what was causing her abdominal pain. After lengthy
  hospital stays and multiple misdiagnosis she was given the news we
  never thought we would hear. As you can imagine, all of this has created incredible financial
  strain on the family as a result of missed work, unexpected expenses,
  deductables, added travel costs, and endless copays. As well as her
  most recent critical surgery to remove the tumors in and around the
  colon, lymphnodes, and ovaries. As anyone could understand it is humbling to not only receive help,
  but even more so to ask for it. Therefore, I am glad to request your
  support for them at this time! Most importantly, we ask you to pray for Toni and her family as they
  move forward in this process, but also to please consider how you
  might help financially. Any amount is greatly appreciated!! In Toni's own words taken from her Facebook page.... ""I have since been able to turn things around and start a new
  path that I believe will result in VICTORY. I must say, I believe in
  God and I know now that he is leading and directing me each and every
  step. No matter the outcome He deserves any and all of the glory!"" On behalf of Toni's family, we are believing it is also her strong
  will and stubbornness that will result in total healing!!! Thank you in advance for all your love, prayer, and support❤ Please share with others who would like to support Toni! And use #toniforlife",https://fundrazr.com/toniforlife
"17,684",Helping Heidi with Cancer Treatments,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,142,"For those that don’t know me I’m Heidi! For everyone else, Hi! And, if you haven’t heard already, please visit my website at https://peanutbutterandcancer.com/ for the full shebang. For those of you that may not be able to visit the website... Here’s the skinny. I have brain cancer. I know what you’re feeling, shock, me too
    when I first found out. It started when I was in North Carolina visiting my mom who was
    having a benign brain tumor removed on October 18th. (She’s
    recovering great.) While there, I began having some difficulty
    reading, super aggressive vomiting, and ultimately a raging
    headache. This lasted for a couple of days. My Nanny fortuitously
    took me to the ER in our hometown to, at the very least, get some
    fluids. During that visit, the docs did a CT scan which showed
    evidence of pressure on my brain and the team recommended further
    testing. So I flew back to Denver, CO on October 23. Noah (my
    husband) and I went to Porter ER for follow up. An MRI revealed a
    mass in my brain and they suggested immediate surgery. On 10/25 I
    underwent a successful surgery to remove the visible portions of the
    25mm mass and the tissue was sent out for testing. I was released
    from the hospital on 10/28. On November 1st, I found
    out I have the deadliest of all 120 types of brain tumors, Stage 4
    Glioblastoma (GBM). And... about 3 weeks ago we received some exciting news.  I tested
  positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV).  Which means the CVM is
    found in 60% of all GBMs.  It's also found in the stem cells of all
    GBMs.  This gives us reason to think the cause of the cancer could
    be from a virus. Which we are currently treating with antiviral
    medications. So, in a world of medicine that's not quite sure what
    to do with GBMs, this gives us a place to start. So, we got some fighting to do, huh? Here’s what treatment looks like. First I radically changed my diet (bye bye sugar and peanut butter) Then we started taking every supplement under the sun that is
    rumored to have anti-cancer properties. After consulting our naturopathic oncologist and nutritionist,
    we've narrowed down what supplements work for me.  Luckily, I've
    been able to take less pills. Yay! We've done the radiation and the first round of chemo. I'll
    still be doing small doses of chemo for the next 6 months. I’ve also been doing a number of alternative and spiritual
    treatments: sound bath, reiki, acupuncture Soon I’ll be starting Optune. (This is the part where I shave my
  head). You can check it out here if you want more info ... https://www.optune.com/ This is what I'll look like with the Optune on What I need from you. Send positive vibes. If you believe in Quantum Physics, you know
    energy can heal. Forward any contacts or resources you may have surrounding
    successful GBM treatments. Consider a monetary donation. Unfortunately, stupid cancer isn't
    cheap. GBM is like a needy, expensive house guest that doesn't know
    when to leave. If you feel compelled to donate, we appreciate your contribution.",https://fundrazr.com/pbandcancer

    diagnostiqué d’un cancer de l'hypopharynx de stade 3. Malgré la
    nouvelle, Philip garde la tête haute et les yeux pleins d’espoir; il
    est prêt à se battre. Pour ce type de cancer, les spécialistes
    estiment une durée de vie de 8 mois ainsi qu’un taux de réussite des
    traitements de chimiothérapie de 30%. Pour combattre la maladie,
    Philip a entamé ses traitements de chimiothérapie. Le type de
    traitement qu’il reçoit se fait par intraveineuse et la durée des
    traitements est de 12 heures par séance, toutes les deux semaines.
    Une fois une séance terminée, celui-ci doit immédiatement se
    retrouver en quarantaine dans un endroit aseptisé durant les 7 jours
    suivant le traitement. Suite à l’état difficile dans lequel les effets secondaires du
    traitement le laissaient, Philip a finalement pris la décision
    d’arrêter ses traitements, afin de profiter au maximum du précieux
    temps qu’il lui reste plutôt que de vivre alité et semi-conscient. Ayant perdu son travail dû au temps qu’il devait accorder à ses
    traitements et à son isolation, Philip doit toutefois continuer de
    manger et de payer son loyer et une inquiétude monétaire s’installe.
    Il est crucial pour la santé mentale de Philip de garder son
    indépendance, de rester autonome et d’avoir une vie active le plus
    longtemps possible. Une santé mentale forte est donc extrêmement
    importante afin qu’il puisse garder la tête haute. Positif, fonceur,
    travaillant, combatif et attentionné, Philip a besoin de votre aide
    afin de conserver son autonomie, mais aussi pour garder espoir. Les Fonds Les fonds que nous souhaitons recueillir pour aider Philip
    permettront de couvrir tous les besoins de base pour une période de
    12 mois: Loyer, hydro, nourriture, médicaments, déplacements,
    téléphone et Internet. Afin de conserver son autonomie ainsi qu’une
    vie active le plus longtemps possible, Philip a besoin d’amasser
    25,000$ afin de couvrir tous les frais et dépenses qui seront
    nécessaires au courant de l’année 2019. Une fois les frais de base
    couverts, Philip aura la chance de se concentrer sur sa ‘Bucket
    list’ et de vivre pleinement chaque instant. Vous pouvez aider Philip de trois façons: - En apportant une contribution monétaire, peu
    importe le montant, afin de l’aider à rester autonome et ainsi lui
    donner une chance de surmonter la maladie, et de vivre ses rêves ; En soutenant Philip par l’achat d’un article ou d’une pièce de
      vêtement de la levée de fond Showing Hope. 50% des profits
      recueillis seront utilisés pour couvrir les besoins de base de
      Philip. Le 50% suivant sera partagé entre la Fondation canadienne
      du Cancer, ainsi que l'Auberge du Coeur L'envolée, une maison pour
      les jeunes sans-abri. https://showinghope.ca/ (N.B.: Le site est présentement en construction) En partageant cette campagne à vos proches, ainsi que sur vos

"1,660",Please Help Us Support Bob's Recovery,Canadian Dollar,"Jun 3, 2019",of $25k goal,12,"HELP BOB GET HIS PROSTHETIC LEG, GET OUTDOOR WHEELS AND MOVE
    TO A WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE APARTMENT We have collectively started this fundraiser for Bob; our Dad,
    Grandpa, Cousin, Partner and Friend who is living with diabetes and
    is now facing his third amputation. Over the past 6 years, Bob’s health has declined dramatically
    going from managing through diet to PD at home 24/7, to in and out
    of ER, being admitted on and off to his recent amputations. The disease is currently expressing itself with acute renal,
    liver failure, high blood pressure and debilitating vascular
    cognitive as well as peripheral artery disease. In November 2018 Bob
    endured two amputations, first a toe which didn’t heal then soon
    afterwards, the below the knee amputation. Bob is now facing the amputation of his other leg which will
    cause us to have to move again. The Fundrazr funds will be managed in a trust. For all the details
  about Bob's budget and health challenges please scroll to the end. Read on for Bob's story and letters from our family... Please help us help Bob . In the next 1- 6 months, he’s facing new costs for a Prosthetic
    leg, outdoor electric wheelchair (his current one is ok indoors but
    can’t go up a hill or keep up with someone walking slowly), a move
    to a wheelchair accessible apartment, payments on a van with a lift
    and the ever increasing list of medications that are not covered.
    We’re posting the details of upcoming expenses below. All
    contributions will be going into a trust managed by our friend and
    lawyer - Amanda Rose. We’ll be posting photos and Amanda will be
    posting updates on how the funds are used. Bob is still hopeful to
    eventually recover from current challenges in order to meet the
    requirements to undergo the kidney transplant. The costs and debt have been piling up and it’s overwhelming.
    Bob's close circle of family has been helping and his partner Fitu
    is working 3 side jobs plus her F/T position as a site resident
    manager, allowing her to care for Bob at home. Until now, we’ve all
    been pretty quiet about this but it’s just not possible anymore. Any help you can offer will be a
    huge help - whether it’s making a donation of any size, commenting
    below, sharing Bob’s story in person, on the phone, in email or
    social media. Let’s get Bob’s story to everyone who knows him on the
    BC coast and beyond. BOB’S STORY Those of you who are lucky enough to share in Bob’s life, you
    know it’s an adventurous one. Fisherman, Father, Friend. Family. Bob
    was born on February 2nd, 1956 and grew up in Burnaby while he spent
    his summers fishing in Alert Bay. As a kid, Bob was fortunate to be invited aboard to join the
    crew on the Cape Cook by Gilbert Cook Sr.. Eventually young Gilbert
    took over and he stayed for a few seasons. Bob also crewed salmon on
    the Jean W., Bruce Luck, Good Partner and the Sleep Robber. He also
    fished herring on the Jean W, Dawn Treader and Waverley. Bob says,
    “I ran the Sea Castle and a few other gillnetters. I can’t recall
    the names but that is just where my brain is going…” Whether on land or water, Bobby is a hard worker. He takes
    utmost pride in caring for his family, his children and
    grandchildren: the loves of his life.  He’s the Bob of all trades,
    and well, master of them, too. While on land Bob is a painter and a
    carpenter and has done repairs, maintenance and renovations from his
    own apartments to large condo complexes. He’s known for his
    attention to meticulous detail...everything must be totally squared off! While on the water, Bob is in his element. Happy, working hard,
    visiting and laughing with people on other boats,  telling stories
    and fooling everyone with his jokes - always delivered as true
    stories with a straight face! FITU & BOB  - OUR CONNECTION Mine and Bob’s long history began with our grandparents.  Our
    grandfathers were seine fisherman from Alert Bay. Our grandmothers
    were best friends who raised their children together in a small town
    and later moved to Vancouver as their families grew in numbers and
    age so they could attend school in the city. Our mothers remained friends throughout their lives and raised
    their children together. Bob and I grew up together, always friends.
    We both went our separate ways, married others and raised our
    children only seeing each other at various family events or during
    the fishing seasons. In 2009, both single, our paths met again; this
    time we brought with us our huge mixed bag of beautiful children.
    Now after 11 years, our family includes grandchildren from our kids
    and our closest friends. As you can see in the photos, the kids are
    Bob’s joy and they feel the same way. Dad, love you from Courtney – Honestly, I am not
  really sure where to start. Not a single day passes by that I don’t
  think of you, even though I don’t see you as often as I would like.
  Bey, Maddox, Laila and I miss you daily and wish we lived closer so we
  could spend more time with you. You have always been the “rock” in my
  life and I just want you to know that if I lived closer, I would
  strive to be the “rock” in yours. You entered my life when I was a baby and even though I was not
  biologically your child, you always treated me as though I was. You
  raised me as though I was your own and I never questioned that I
  wasn’t (besides wondering why my hair was dark and Britt’s and Nick’s
  was blond LOL). Even when I learned that you weren’t my biological
  father, I never felt that you were anything other than my dad. YOU
  were the one who helped teach me to walk, talk, ride a bike, drive,
  etc. Through every milestone in my life, YOU were there. YOU were my rock. Some of my best memories are the times we spent on the fishing
  boat. Bringing in the nets, playing with sea creatures, scrubbing the
  decks and beautiful sunsets taught me more about life then you will
  ever know. Seeing killer whales so close to the boat we could touch
  them was such an amazing experience that has remained in my mind all
  these years. Although the large storms and trying to find other boats
  to tie up to were scary as a child, you always made us feel secure and
  safe. I wouldn’t trade these memories in for the world. I know my teenage years were not easy for anyone, but you
  handled them like a champ. I was a terrible teenager, but you NEVER
  treated me as such. The nights of me failing to come home, my
  dishonesty, and the many bad decisions I made never changed the way
  you treated me or felt about me. One of your best attributes is that
  you NEVER judge people. Many times during this rough time in my life I
  felt judged by people but never by you. No matter what I did or didn’t
  do you were always there. I remember the many times you came to find
  me and when you did, there were no questions asked. No judgement. No
  yelling. You accepted me as I was and never pushed me away. I could
  tell you anything without fear of judgement or being in trouble. I
  want you to know that without your support during this time, I am not
  sure that the outcome would ended up as good as it did. Again, you
  were always my rock. It is because of your support that I am
  where I am today – happily married with 2 wonderful kids. Bey
  considers you as a father and has the utmost respect for you. Maddox
  and Laila ask about grandpa all the time. They always ask how grandpa
  is doing and when he will come down to visit next. Maddox especially
  understands what grandpa is going through and is so empathetic and
  helpful it amazes me. We all understand this time in your life has taken a physical
  and emotional toll on you. Like you always told me “life isn’t easy”.
  You have so much support and love that if we all work together, we can
  help make your “new” life as easy and enjoyable as possible for you. I want to say thank you to Fitu. I know this has also been
  physically and emotionally hard on you as well. Dad is extremely lucky
  to have you in his life. The amount of time you dedicate towards dads
  care is incredible and you do it all without any complaint. I know you
  are his “rock”. You are one of the most selfless people I know and
  from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate everything you have done and
  continue to do for my dad. My rock. For Dad, love Brit - I often reflect on the
  continuous presence you have in my life – the days, weeks and years
  through which your duty as my father has brought nothing but pure
  enjoyment. You are a support of strength, encouragement and
  discipline. Your love is endless - you are a man to be admired. From a young age, I can remember the many hours you spent
  playing with me, the thousands of kisses goodnight and the countless
  trips out for meals when dinner on the table was “questionable”. I
  recognize the moments for which you were and are there – no matter the
  sacrifice. You give me all the love, time, care and appreciation that
  you have available. I am grateful for the countless phone calls and
  advice given when I have no one else to turn to. As though it was yesterday, I remember you gifting me my first
  car and shortly after that helping me shop for the car of my dreams.
  Truth be told, I had no idea what the process entailed and was a
  little overwhelmed in the moment, but as with every other milestone in
  my life you held my hand and walked me through it all. By the end of
  the day, I had a car of my own and the freedom to take me where I
  needed to go. That freedom took me to university, where you continued to
  provide your infinite support of home cooked meals and a roof over my
  head, albeit not always with walls. The day I graduated your sported a
  look of “honored father”, one that boasted how proud you were of me
  and shouted to the world that you had all the confidence and trust in
  it to guide me through to the next journey in my life. Not many years after that, you waited (not so) patiently outside
  of my delivery room where you were blessed with one of the most kind,
  loving and caring little boys you will ever have the pleasure of
  knowing. I knew right away that the bond between you two would be
  special and that your firm and gentle touch was as loving as could be.
  Again, those tears in your eyes told me just how proud you were of me
  in that particular moment in time. From there we traveled to Los Cabos where you met me in my suite
  to walk me down the aisle on my wedding day. Neither one of us knew
  what to do, how slowly we should walk, where we should look or how to
  link arms, and just like that the moment flew by. We got to the
  gazebo, you blinked back tears and you couldn’t say a word. The
  message was clear – you were proud. Each of the milestones mentioned above, along with many more
  occurred as I transitioned from a child to an adult. Each symbolized a
  moment when I needed to be guided in order to grow. Your loyalty,
  confidence and unconditional support has moved mountains in my life,
  and there are still mountains left to move, so don’t think for a
  second that your job is done! I need you in the years ahead, and to
  play your role with fineness. I need you more than ever. I often reflect on the continuous presence you have in my life –
  the days, weeks and years through which your duty as my father has
  brought nothing but pure enjoyment. You are a support of strength,
  encouragement and discipline. Your love is endless - you are a man to
  be admired. From Jojo Our Creature As Carson’s’ nanny, I serendipitously, etc. etc. etc. met Bobby
  April 2016. I was the last to know there was an existing established
  relationship between my “ward” and Bobby and Fitu. Why are these
  people cooing over my sweetie pie in the elevator? How do they know
  his name? Why is my sweetie pie responding so lovingly to these
  strangers? Thank you, Bobby for… (loving Little as his own / loving me
  as his own.) One random Tuesday, this familiar stranger Bobby invited me and
  my sweetie pie to spend the day at the beach, which happen to turn out
  to be the first of many. I am Jody, but I happily spent many warm, sunny beautiful days
  as “Brittany” while our sweetie pie vacillated between being Carson in
  flesh and nostalgically baby Linden. Other times our sweetie pie was
  Baby Nick, other days he was Maddox. Some days I was Courtney. We sure
  had to keep an eye on curious Baby Wayne! I hadn’t yet met Bobby’s
  children, but I felt a comfortable closeness to each of them. I knew
  and felt Carson and I were safe and loved with this familiar
  stranger…the three of us journeying through time and space Jody and
  Carson, and Wayne and Courtney and Brittany and Nick and Skye and
  Maddox and Laila and Linden loved up and safely kept by Bobby, their
  Father, their Grandpa…this familiar stranger, my friend. As Summer turned to Fall things got real: Bobbly learned
  feminism and Jody learned to bite her tongue. Let’s face it, social
  graces between Bobby and I fell quicker and more plentiful than the
  autumn leaves. I gifted Bobby with the privilege of gender politics
  and all that is Feminism. I was gifted in return with the ins and outs
  of Republicans. Poor Fitu had to share her own living room with Fox
  News and Bobby and Jody and our thoughts Hawkins cheesies and our
  opinions and for some reason I don’t think either Bobby or I kept
  things to a dull roar. From Deb - Meeting you “My Bob” (as my kids call you
  ) 6 years ago , we would never have imagined what a great influence
  you would have on our life. All the time you spent with my girls especially Iylah who came
  out of her shyness so quickly with you and Fitu, coming over when our
  sink flooded in the middle of the night , helping me scrape paint off
  my window sills due to my lousy painting ability, bbqing us chicken
  burgers, being my go to guy when it came to a lot of things and so on.
  You will never know how much I appreciate everything you’ve done for
  us. You are a perfect example of a wonderful Grandpa , Dad and
  friend is and we are lucky to call you family. Our love for you
  is immense and we adore and support you always! Deb From Amaya - I don’t even know where do begin. You
  are awesome all around I wanna say thank you for everything you’ve
  done for me, my mom, and my sisters. I know it may seem I don’t
  acknowledge anymore lol but know I love you and appreciate everything
  you’ve done for us From Zaida - My Bob there are no words that describe
  how much I love you. You have always been there for me like a dad and
  I can’t thank you enough. Thank you for all the chicken burgers,
  wheelchair rides, babysitting, and so much more. Know that I am always
  here for you cause you were always there for me. Love you. From Iylah - My Bob. I love you so much you were the
  best babysitter ever I miss seeing you every day and cuddling in the
  lobby with you. You always make me laugh and I wish I didn’t
  have to go to school so I could hang out with you more Thank you
  for always being there for me love you Thank you for reading, caring,
    helping, sharing and being part of Bob’s story! We also want to say
    that although we’re facing another crisis, we’re grateful for all
    the love and support - time and money - so far. As can be well imagined, Bob’s life has made dramatic shift. We
    are so proud of all our children, grandchildren, friends and family
    who have joined us in this ever changing journey, it has certainly
    been challenging and enlightening. We’re very grateful to our huge
    mixed bag of kids, brothers Kevin and Doug, their wives Carolyn and
    Sue, Aunt Carol, Uncle David,  Aunt Marni and Uncle John as well as
    friends that were available to visit, offering their loving support
    both emotionally and financially. The grandkids have especially been awesome! They’ve displayed
    loving curiosity while being very patient, never, ok rarely whining,
    complaining or acting out. Love you all tons and we are so blessed
    to have you all Skylar, Maddox, Linden, Mikhail, Giaan, Carson and
    our beautiful Laila.  To the eldest; Sky you display such absolute
    amazing character for a 16 yr old young man, how you help, play and
    patiently care for the young ones. Mikhail, your FaceTime and
    pictures from the other side of the world are heartwarmingly
    precious, we are grateful. All of the parents have done a fabulous
    job helping the ‘lil ones navigate this difficult time…. you have
    all done well considering the situation. The grandones don’t fully
    understand what’s happening although for the youngest ones, it’s the norm. I am especially grateful to my assistant/friend Deb for her
    constant reliability and devotion, and to her 3 amazing girls, who
    all refer to Bob as “their Bob”. Deb has been instrumental in
    allowing me to devote so much of my time to being there for Bob. DLL, as always thank you for your ear, heart and brilliant mind.
    Your calm, quiet presence and the solid support is a precious gift.
     Tom, thank you as well. BNG, thank you for always checking in and being there no matter
    how crazy busy you are. The unconditional love, goofy antics and
    support along with your generosity means everything. AJR, as always, eternally grateful for you, your kind heart,
    sharp legal mind, meals left outside the door, beautiful time
    consuming and thoughtfully created gifts. I also would like to especially thank who we lovingly and
    jokingly refer to as our 42-year-old teenager Jojo.  She constantly
    makes herself available to be with Bob if I’m not. She regularly
    does grocery runs and has become our garbage fairy (as she leaves
    she will grab our garbage hauling it to garbage room). Jojo will sit
    in his room visiting, easily chatting or in silence often doing her
    crafts as he rests, watches TV or sleeps.  Her gentle, loving,
    subdued inconspicuous concern and charming ways make his days pass
    easier. Sandy, your exquisitely blended oils created with love, prayers
    and healthy blessings continue to benefit Bob, thank you. I must also acknowledge the boys;  for hauling furniture around
    up and down the building organizing our condo to accommodate Bob’s
    wheel chair, medical equipment and years of packing boxes of
    dialysis solution, picking up the slack in all the lil constant
    things Bob used to do for me at work.  Grateful they all live so
    close by, able to help whenever I call or just randomly drop by. And
    to our Spring/Summer imported one, Leo you are always willing to
    help with a huge grin, thank you. A huge thank you to Courtney and Bey for gifting the indoor
    electric wheelchair, it’s made your Dad’s life so much easier.
     Although you both are very busy with careers and kids you make
    certain to keep in touch. Bey, we are forever grateful for the care,
    love and support you constantly demonstrate to us, especially Dad. Wayne, Jr., Gibran and Ale, you have been very generous with
    your loving support, time  and financial assistance these last
    years, we are grateful. To Brit, your regular upbeat and positive cheerful calls are
    heartwarming, we acknowledge that these last years have been
    extremely difficult for you. Adam we are grateful for your support
    and care in all that you do, especially the late night delivery of
    oxygen tanks. To both Dan and Bryan, thank you for sitting with him regularly
    while in the hospital giving me a break and allowing me to run home
    for a shower.  Bryan, Dan, Edgar and Jack you continue to be there,
    still making the effort to take Bob out getting together for a meal. WHY FUNDRAZR - DETAILS ON WHY BOB NEEDS HELP Bob receives CPP Disability of $1032 monthly. Together with
    Fitu’s income, there is a backwards slide every month and credit has
    been maxed out for a while. Our family Fundrazr campaign is to cover the areas listed
    below. Please consider donating; all funds raised will be held in a
    Trust Account set up by a lawyer who’s generously offering her time.
    All funds will be allocated towards Bob’s medical expenses, recovery
    and transitions to begin living his “new normal” life.  Any extra
    funds will be used for getting him some part time assistance as Fitu
    is working F/T and can’t always be with him. PROSTHETIC LEG - $4,000-$5,000 (balance of $10,000
    paid by Medical) Bob’s right foot and leg to the knee have already been
    amputated. Prosthetic leg costs are only partially covered. At this
    time, funds will only be used for the prosthetic for his right leg.
    We’re still in the process and will update when we know the exact
    amount that we’ll need. Fingers crossed that Bob will once again be
    able to golf, get out on the water again and work around the
    apartment tower. OUTDOOR ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIR - $5500 Bob will require an outdoor electric wheelchair. The one he has
    right now is very low power and not designed to go outside. It can’t
    make it up even a slight incline. Bob will have a lot more mobility
    and be able to get out and about, go grocery shopping and enjoy the
    spring with the grandkids. MOVING TO A WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY APARTMENT - $2400 (Moving Expenses $1200 + Rent Increase $200x 6/mo = $1200). The suite we currently live in is not wheelchair friendly and
    Bob has extreme difficulty moving about. The doorways are very
    narrow, he’s unable to ride into bathroom as the door opens in, so
    he must leave it in the hallway and hop into the bathroom, so far
    he’s fallen three times trying to negotiate his way in. Our kitchen
    is difficult for Bob to use, whereas the new one will only have one
    long bank of cabinets and appliances, not a “U” shape. Bob has always been a great cook and the new kitchen will make
    it possible for him to make food safely. We will be moving two buildings away to the 4th tower.  We are
    limited as to where we can live because of my work as an onsite
    resident managing the building.  The same developer will have an
    accessible friendly suite ready for us. We will incur moving
    expenses along with a $200 monthly rent increase to what we
    currently pay but with the prognosis of extended rehab and the
    likelihood of another amputation we don’t have much of a choice. MEDICATION - $1100 x 6/ mo = $6600 Bob’s dialysis solution are covered by BC Medical. However, we
    pay cash for the diabetes and blood pressure medication. A new cost
    since March is Bob’s Chinese herbal medicines which are specifically
    for circulation for the leg. He’s noticed an improvement and the
    medicines will help keep the remaining leg and arms healthy so Bob
    can continue to live life to the fullest and do the things he loves
    like cooking for the family and playing with the kids. VAN THAT CAN TRANSPORT THE WHEELCHAIR  - $4320 Bob is in and out of the hospital. Plus there are a ton of
    doctors appointments. In November, we purchased a new van to
    transport Bob, wheelchair and dialysis equipment and supplies.
    Payments are $720/ month. $4320 of raised funds will cover 6 months
    and take a bit of financial pressure off. The journey to help Bob stabilize and live many more years
      is ongoing and we’re grateful to all of our family and friends
      who’ve been there and continue to be. BOB'S MEDICAL HISTORY 2012  July - Diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and
    high blood pressure.  At this point all was blood work and symptoms were an indication that Bob was hopeful
    to control the symptoms with diet and medicine. 2013 Diabetes controlled with medications and diet adjustments as was
    blood pressure. Losing sensation in feet due to diabetic neuropathy, onset of
    almost constant nausea accompanied by lack of energy.  Back then I began rating his
    overall well-being as 3-4 good days followed by 1 bad day. 2014 Diagnosed with the beginning stages of kidney failure, altered
    diet yet again, this was a struggle to balance a diabetic friendly diet with the renal
    failure diet. i.e. nuts and cheese recommended for diabetics are not permitted for renal patients. 2015 Followed by his nephrologist, Kidney Clinic and
  several other health professionals - opthamologist,
    cardiologist, internal medicine, vascular surgeon etc. 2016 March Began daily Peritoneal Dialysis , 6
    cycles/exchanges per day.  Improved energy with blood work reflecting stabilizing symptoms with treatment. 2017 Peritoneal Dialysis treatment was causing other issues with
    peritoneal cavity and organs. Diagnosed with hernias caused by PD and the weight of
    2000 ml of solution constantly putting pressure on lining and supporting muscles. Oct - Began the process for preparing for a kidney
    transplant, unfortunately there were ongoing complications and
    increasing health issues compromising the viability of a transplant.
     As quickly as our medical system permitted we began addressing each
    concern only to constantly find another. The diabetes, although well
    controlled, was slowly and quietly but effectively destroying his
    eyes, weakening other organs, affecting the mind and circulation.
    Renal failure causes the destruction of soft muscle tissue, heart,
    liver, lungs etc. Liver function tests were showing that the enzymes
    are unhealthy, showing that there were cysts, scar tissue and the
    beginning of cirrhosis. Bob was told that he’ll eventually require a liver transplant as
    well but it should not interfere with a kidney transplant.  His
    heart has 50% blockage in the upper apex the surgeon will wait to
    insert stents when it is at 70% and appears to be fine aside from
    the high blood pressure. Since 2016 Bob has been closely followed by an Opthamologist,
    monthly he would see her, for scans, injections and laser treatments
    to increase eye health and vision.  She was successful, Bob’s vision
    is actually pretty good. The prognosis is also positive as for some
    time he was very fearful and worried that he’d be blind as well. Another prerequisite for Bob’s health to remain on the
    transplant list is that all of his dental work must be certified by
    a dentist so as not be a risk for future infection, advised that the
    most effective and absolute way to ensure that would be to have his
    remaining teeth extracted and be fitted for dentures. Fortunately
    with the financial help from Kevin and Carolyn, Bob was able to have
    this done in November 2018. One more step towards transplant, or as
    Bob would say, ""one hop at a time"" . 2018 Jan - at this point the side effects of peritoneal
    dialysis were debilitating and Bob remained bed ridden most of the times. Constant nausea and
    vomiting for 5 months requiring weekly trips to emergency for IVs to
    increase fluid in body, extreme weight and muscle mass loss. June - Hemodialysis treatment alleviated the nausea
    and seemed to overall increase Bob’s energy. July - Final stages of extensive transplant testing
    the Kidney Transplant team has determined that although I am a
    match, because Bob has received transfusions he now has antibodies
    that will not accept my kidney.  We are now included in a program
    called “Paired Donors” - this program matches a recipient and a
    donor with another set of participants across Canada, exchanging the
    available donor kidney. Aug - Tiny cut on right fourth toe eventually
    presented signs of gangrene, rounds of antibiotics were unsuccessful to cure infection. As the weeks
    and months passed without sufficient circulation to support the healing the entire toe was
    affected. Sept - During the 3 times weekly in hospital
    treatments of hemodialysis Bob regularly contracted infections and suffered with horrible stomach issues. At this point he chose to give PD another try.  Once he switched
    back to daily home administered peritoneal dialysis, stomach issues
    and infections no longer an issue.  Prognosis was to Insert stents
    to hopefully facilitate healing or at the very least to assist the
    healing of foot once toe was amputated. Oct 9 Admitted to RCH Angioplasty to insert stents in right leg to increase
    circulation to facilitate healing of toe October amputated toe Nov 6 amputated right leg below knee Now the rush is on to rearrange our condo, purchase all the
    required mobility equipment to begin our “new normal” lives. Nov 19 discharged from RCH - the healing process at
    home was slow but fortunately with being followed weekly by RCH’s
    awesome team at the Wound and Limb preservation clinic and his
    Vascular Surgeon Bob’s wound healed with only 2 infections. 2019 Left foot -  painful, extremely cold, no circulation discoloured
    red and no feeling in toes. Testing to determine blood flow and circulation - 50% of October
    2018 results March - amputation wound sufficiently healed to
    begin the process to be fitted for a prosthetic leg/foot which will
    cost $10-12,000.  On the wait list for rehab. March 4 - Chinese Dr. attended Bob at home to
    diagnose and try to help with lower leg and foot circulation to
    possibly save it from amputation.  Prescribed a twice daily dose of
    herbs. March 8 - Vascular Surgeon advises to wait and
    see, will eventually attempt to insert another stent as a last
    chance to postpone inevitable lower leg from amputation. March 23 - Wait list to begin training to perform
    home hemodialysis. April 2 - Continued positive results, less pain
    while continuing the Chinese Medicines. Thanks again for helping Bob!
    Please comment, spread the word and help him reach his Fundrazr
    goal, move to the new apartment and get his new leg. Everything
    helps and, Bob likes to say,  it's ""one hop at time!""",https://fundrazr.com/HelpSupportBob

"1,821,382",American Gut,,,,,"The Human Microbiome Project and other microbiome projects
    worldwide have laid an important foundation for understanding the
    trillions of microbes that inhabit our bodies and their impact on
    health and disease. However, opportunities for the public to get
    involved in such research have been limited. Now, American Gut gives
    you an opportunity to join this research project and learn what’s
    living on and inside you. American Gut is a project built on the open-source, open-access
    principles of the Earth Microbiome Project. The data we collect is
    de-identified and then deposited into open repositories for the
    benefit of other researchers and scientists.  By participating in
    our project, you can help contribute to research that will help the
    world understand how the microbiome affects our health. In exchange
    for your participation, we generate a report summarizing the types
    of microbes observed in your sample, and how your sample relates to
    other people in the study. While American Gut mainly focuses on the gut as this is where
    most of our microbes reside, we will also look at areas like the
    oral and skin, as these areas of the body also contain microorganisms. The American Gut Project is a part of the Microsetta Initiative , with
    the goal of collecting microbiome samples and rich phenotypic data
    from populations across the globe. Some examples of what we have found using our data: Younger
  children tend to have more proteobacteria composing their microbiome.
   As you grow older, the diversity of your microbiome increases. (Based off our preliminary findings in 2014,
      found here ) There’s a significant difference between the types of bacteria
    found in industrialized populations vs. non-industrialized populations. McDonald et al. mSystems . May 2018. DOI: 10.1128/mSystems.00031-18 Joining is simple! Select the kit you would like from the list
    of options on the right-hand side by clicking “Claim this perk” (if
    you would like to receive a certain number of kits that isn’t listed
    as a perk, email us at info@americangut.org ) . Your kit
    will arrive via USPS within 2 weeks after payment, unless you have added the “Priority Shipping”
    perk along with your kit. If You Live in Europe: Visit our sister site, British Gut , to join. If You Live in Australia or Singapore: While we do have sites set up in Australia and Singapore (known
    as Australian Gut and Asian Gut respectively), we ask that participants contribute an additional $25 on top
    of their contribution, which covers an international shipping fee . These sites allow participants to send their samples back to a
    local site, which then sends the samples back to our lab in the U.S.
    to reduce the costs of shipping. If you live in Australia or Singapore and would like to
    participate, claim a perk.  The next page will have an option to
    ""top off"" your contribution with an additional amount,
    which you will use to add in the $25 to mark your kit to go out. I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not be
      sent out until we have received it. Once we have received your transaction, we will forward your
    information to our collaborators. They will then send out a kit to
    you, which you will receive within 3 weeks . Please note that the r eturn time for results will take significantly longer than the
    expected 3 months for Australian/Asian Gut participants. The reason
    is that we have to bulk ship samples on dry ice back to our lab at
    UC San Diego.  This costs thousands of dollars per shipment, so it’s
    only feasible to do once enough samples are ready to ship. If You Live Anywhere
    Else: International participants are also
    welcome to join. The $25 international shipping fee also applies (which you must include in your contribution), along with other regulations . I f you do not include the $25 shipping fee, your kit will not
      be sent out until we have received it. We also ask that samples are shipped back to our lab within 48 hours of being collected. The cost of shipping to our lab in the U.S. from some
    locations can be expensive , so it is recommended that you look into the cost of return
    shipping (it is highly suggested to use FedEx as it is more
    reliable). If you are interested in learning the process of our project
    from start to finish, we have a video available here . Each kit contains a sample tube (or more, if ordered), an
    instruction manual on how to register your kit and take a sample,
    credentials to access our participant website, and return
    envelope(s) to send your sample back. Your results will provide a general overview of how your microbial profile
    compares to other participants ( these results are not intended to be medically actionable,
      and we cannot provide any personalized interpretation ). You will also receive a list of the microorganisms found in
    your sample and their relative abundances (based at the genus
    level).  Results are uploaded via our participant website, which you
    will get access to once you register your kit. For stool samples, it will take about 3 months for you to receive your results, and longer for those who are
      participating outside the U.S. (due to shipping procedures to send
      samples back to our lab, which is based at the University of
      California San Diego).  It takes approximately 4-5 months to
      receive results if you submit one of the following sample types: Oral or skin samples . A desktop computer or laptop is recommended to register and log your sample into our
      participant portal website, as our participant website has
      compatibility issues on mobile devices and tablets.  The best
      browser to use when you register your kit is Google Chrome . Note that your de-identified information will be part of a
      research study and will be made available in a publicly available
      research database. That is, any personal information that might
      easily identify who you are will be removed before being placed in
      the public database. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this
      study, please send a request to the American Gut Project help
      account ( info@americangut.org ) to inform us of your intent to withdraw. You may request a
      refund within 50 days of your original payment if you have not yet used your kit. Please note that the Fundrazr transaction fee will be

"1,715",Let's help Panagiotis get the cancer treatment he deserves!,Canadian Dollar,,of $3k goal,28,"Panagiotis Hazapis is the name of one of the most kind-hearted and
  generous people I have ever met. Every day for him is a day of serving
  others. He feeds all the village strays, spends time sharing knowledge
  with the village children, checks in with the aging members of the
  community regularly, and recently saved one of their lives, just
  because he was there and the timing was right. Panagiotis is one of the real victims of the Greek financial crisis.
  After a lifetime of hard work, paying his taxes, and paying in to the
  government pension, doing everything by the book, he now finds himself
  receiving only 1/3 of what his pension was promised to be. Though this
  is hardly enough to support himself and his wife, he would give the
  shirt off his back to anyone in need and never complains about the
  circumstances they've been handed. They have adapted to their
  situation and live modestly, but cannot afford the dilemma they are
  now faced with. We have just learned that Panagiotis has been diagnosed with prostate
  cancer.  The Greek healthcare system will only cover the cost of
  therapy using an archaic radiation machine, which would result in
  numerous side effects and offer a very low success rate. The best
  course of action, a laproscopic surgery to remove the tumor, will cost
  5000 euro (roughly $7500 Canadian dollars), which is something they
  unfortunately cannot afford. Having this surgery would allow him to
  live out his remaining years with his wife by his side, doing what he
  loves most; caring for the village and all who reside within it. If we can find 1000 people willing to sacrifice their Starbucks for a
  day, we have a chance at helping this incredible, selfless man beat
  the odds.  Whatever funds we are not able to raise we will be
  contributing ourselves, so any contribution, no matter how big or
  small, is greatly appreciated. Panagiotis is a proud man and would never want to ask for help from
  others.  Unfortunately pride will not allow him to receive this
  important and life-saving procedure, so we have taken it upon
  ourselves to reach out to the community for help. Thank you in advance.",https://fundrazr.com/a1TAD7
"1,732",Help Us Make Ireland's Dream a Reality!,U.S. Dollar,,of $500k goal,25,"Hello, we are Megan and Mark. Over three years ago Megan gave birth
  to our beautiful baby girl, Ireland. However, during birth, an
  umbilical cord prolapse resulted in Ireland having cererbal palsy. She
  spent the first 7 weeks of life in the hospital, and we waitied
  anxiously to take her home to her older brothers. This was our first real world experience with cerebral palsy. Many
  people we talk to today don't even know what cerebral palsy is.
  Cerebral palsy is a variable type of brain injury that affects people
  in many different ways. Some children are only slightly affected,
  while others are permamently disabled, wheelchair-bound, and need
  constant attendant care. Cerebral palsy makes a huge impact on the family dynamic. Not only
  are many cerebral palsy families financially dessimated by this
  disease, but they are also stressed emotionally and physically. There are no treatments out there that are covered by insurance to
  treat or reverse cererbal palsy. However, there are many, many
  therapies available worldwide that improve cerebral palsy, and can
  have significant impacts on quality of life. Unfortunately, most of
  these therapies are difficult to obtain due to lack of insurance
  coverage and travel costs. We were lucky enough to discover and utilize many of these therapies
  for Ireland, and have seen dramatic improvements in her since using
  these therapies. We truly believe that no child with cerebral palsy
  should have his or her treatment options limited by his or her
  parent's financial status. Out of this belief, Ireland's Dream was born. Ireland's Dream is to establish a medical center that is fully
  dedicated to the treatment of people with cerebral palsy and their
  families. This Center will have the latest in treatment technologies
  that people all over the world are using for cerebral palsy, available
  under one roof. These therapies include hyperbaric oxygen, ozone
  therapy, Cuevas Medek therapy, scoliosis treatment, and vibration
  therapy. Other necessary therapies will include family counseling,
  diet/nutritional interventions, feeding therapy, assistive device
  training, and more. Our goal is to make cerebral palsy synonymous with Ireland's Dream.
  Please help us make Ireland's Dream come true for patients all over
  the country who are suffering from the debilitating disease. We thank you greatly for any support you can provide.",https://fundrazr.com/f13EF1

  finishing the 2014 CrossFit Open ranked 37th in the World (M40-44) to
  being told 3 days later he had malignmant melenoma cancer. There
  were no warning signs. No ""bad moles"" after regular
  dematology checks. He did everything RIGHT. Then just 3 days after
  the news, he was told the cancer had spread to his brain and was
  now terminal stage 4, he had just 3 months to live unless he had
  surgery to remove the brain tumor. Jason underwent brain surgery Friday May 2nd to remove the 1""
  tumor from his occipitical lobe and is home recovering well now. Jason
  and the Dr's attribute the speedy recovery to his excellent fitness
  conditioning from CrossFit ! This is truly just the beginning of the challenges ahead for the
  entire Fine Family. His sister (46) is also has Stage 4 Melenoma
  Cancer and has been fighting it for the past 18 months. Treatment will
  be intense and long. He has additional Gamma Knife treatment scheduled
  May 23rd and then possibly a year of immuno/chemo-therapy after they
  find out what the genetic mutation was. His family, friends and
  community stand behind him in this WAR. We are asking for donations to help with the costs of treatments
  coming this next year, which we all know will escalate quickly. Jason
  does have health insurance but a hgih deducatle plan and no
  perscription drug coverage. He was always healthy and it wasnt needed.
  Now, EVERY dollar you donate will go directly to the chemo therapy and
  medication since he does not have this coverage. This will help Jason

  months. What started out as exciting news of an addition to their
  family, turned into a molar pregnancy taking that joy
  away. After processing the loss, and surgery to remove the mass,
  Liz had her levels monitored regularly to make sure everything was on track. In mid January, Liz's levels started rising, so she was brought in
  last week for an ultrasound and chest X-ray. These confirmed that a
  mass had returned and she was scheduled for surgery the following
  Tuesday. In the meantime, a CT was ordered. Tuesday came and the CT
  showed that the tumor was malignant and had metastasized to her lungs.
  Surgery was no longer an option. Yesterday, February 7th, the doctor
  called and said they didn't want to wait to start treatment. A PICC
  line was placed and inpatient chemo started today. Her port will be
  placed on Tuesday. This has been a very fast and very intense ride for Liz and her
  family. Another outpatient surgery turned into a minimum of four
  months of chemotherapy; they will need a lot of support from family
  and friends. I'm asking all who know Liz, Joe and Ryan, those who don't but
  understand the long battle ahead, or those who simply have a giving
  spirit and the monetary ability, to donate whatever amount you can. Unplanned childcare costs, lost wages, deductibles, etc. will be
  building very quickly. For those who don't know her, Liz is one of the most incredible

"152,570",Help James McCarthy in his battle against leukemia,U.S. Dollar,,of $100k goal,973,"How you can help: Donate to James’ care: https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay Register to be a bone marrow donor: http://www.bethematch.org/ James’ Story: On Tuesday, August 7th we were leaving the house for Rita’s birthday
  dinner when we received a voicemail from James’ doctor. She said to call immediately and left her personal cell phone
    number. As we walked, James was being his usual self:
  running down Southport Ave and acting like a healthy, happy little
  boy. Forty-eight hours later, James would be in critical
  condition, on a ventilator, and fighting for his life.  Two days after
  that James was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Leukemia. When we called the doctor back, she shared that a routine blood test
  showed James’ white blood cell count was abnormally high and she
  wanted us to get more tests done by the Leukemia and cancer
  specialists at Lurie’s Children Hospital. To put it in
  perspective, healthy children usually have a white blood cell count of
  5,000 to 10,000. James’ was at 32,000. Thursday was the soonest appointment we could get with a hematologist
  - a doctor who specializes in diseases of the blood. The
  doctors at Lurie’s confirmed that something was not right. They wanted to get a bone marrow sample to figure out what was
  going on and the quickest way to the front of the line was to have
  James admitted. At that point, there wasn’t a high level
  of concern for James’ immediate health. We spent the day
  playing with trucks, reading books, watching “gee” (Curious George)
  and looking at cars, trucks, buses and all his favorite sights of the
  city from the hospital room window. On Friday morning at 9:30 am, James underwent a procedure to extract
  a bone marrow and a bone sample from his hip. The
  doctor’s shared what they were testing for: James likely either had
  Leukemia or an auto-immune disease. Devastation. A few hours later the oncologist (cancer doctor) called us to the
  consultation room for a discussion. She shared what was
  seemingly good news. The initial blood results had ruled
  out the most common types of Leukemia, which typically make up more
  than 99% of annual childhood Leukemia diagnosis. The
  only cancer they couldn’t rule out was a very rare form of Leukemia
  called Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, or JMML. We
  would later learn that JMML is so rare that there are currently only
  20 kids diagnosed in the U.S. While we didn’t yet have an answer for what was affecting James, we
  cautiously celebrated the news since the other options were an auto
  immune disease or pneumonia.  We were told the rest of the tests would
  likely come back on Monday. That night James’ health rapidly deteriorated. His
  temperature spiked to 104. His heart rate was racing at
  200 beats per minute. His lungs began to fail. To help his little body the nurses and doctors put him on
  oxygen and a few IVs. While we were scared – and not
  knowing what was happening – we at least had the benefit of being able
  to talk to the doctors. James didn’t. As the night progressed, the doctor’s wanted to increase his oxygen
  to help with his lungs; and to do so, he needed to be moved to the
  Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and only they could administer
  the higher dosage. For the next 24-hours, James would not rest; his body would not let
    him. Each time he did fall asleep, he would wake up 10
  to 20 minutes later terrified and not knowing what was happening.  His
  body was in overdrive, IVs and sensors all over his body, a tube
  inserted down his nose into his stomach – how could he understand? It was excruciating. His body was being
    overworked. He was having trouble breathing. He was not getting the rest needed. He was
  pleading with all the words he had.  “All done.” “Momma.” “Up.”
  “Outside.” It was heartbreaking and terrifying to watch
  our poor little baby so scared and so sick, feeling completely helpless. The PICU team told us what we could already see.  James’ body
  could not sustain this pace on his own, so we made the decision to
  sedate and intubate him (put on a breathing machine.) It
  was mentally impossible to hear but we knew it had to be done.  We sat
  bedside with James as he was sedated and the breathing tubes inserted
  into his lungs.  This was two days after we walked into the hospital
  with a seemingly healthy little boy. Saturday brought a new bombshell. The only piece of
  good news we had received instantly disappeared. Our
  James had JMML, the rarest type of childhood Leukemia. The doctors now suspected that James did not have pneumonia. Instead it was leukemia filling his little lungs with white
  blood cells. James’ white blood cell count accelerated
  rapidly throughout the day from 30,000 (which we previously thought
  was unimaginably high) to 50,000 to 78,000 to 90,000 to 111,000 to 128,000. Our little James was now in critical condition. Some of
  the best doctors in Chicago were working with him minute-by-minute,
  hour-by-hour to keep him going. Everything had happened
  so fast that we didn’t even have time to process one bit of news
  before we had moved onto another. But we kept in mind
  one thing: if you’ve met James, you know he is a strong-willed little
    toddler. If anyone can battle this, it’s James. While James’ lungs were responding to the breathing machine, it
  wasn’t enough.  The doctors decided to move him to a
  new ventilator that could also administer anesthesia gas in addition
  to breathing for James.  This machine had to be brought up from the
  E.R. and had only been used a few times on the PICU floor over the
  past two years. We were told James may be the sickest
  patient in the hospital (438 patients) and that he was fighting for
  his life. We were grasping for straws. The doctors told us they
  were running out of things to try. We
  discussed unproven options that had never been tried on a patient as
  young as James. We signed consent forms. Fortunately, the new machine began to stabilize James and we took
  some of those options off the table.  During “rounds” the next
  morning we counted thirteen doctors and nurses around James’ room to
  get an update on his condition.  We felt like we were in the right
  place with the right level of attention from an incredibly experienced
  medical staff. We had tremendous support from family and
  friends – all rallying around James and supporting us day and night. On Sunday, August 12th- just 5 days after receiving that urgent
  call from the doctor - James started Chemo. His chemo is
  now administered twice a day. Once for
    30-minutes. Later in the day for 4-hours. He typically also requires a blood transfusion. This is in addition to the 18-25 drips of medication he is on
  every hour. As crazy as it sounds, this is only part of the story over the past
  week. There have been other challenges with blood
  pressure, his lungs filling with carbon dioxide (CO2), scary
  challenges switching him to new medical machinery, but tough little
  James is making progress. On Wednesday the 15th he moved
  to a smaller ventilator. His white blood cells are down
  to 30,000. While still on anesthesia, James has been resting in bed with his
  night time puppy, Curious George stuffed animal and a pacifier in one
  hand and his favorite toy truck in the other. We have
  been reading James books, which is very difficult while keeping your
  emotions in check. James has a long fight in front of him. It’s scary to
  think about all the challenges ahead but right now we are focused on
  today. One step at a time, then we will tackle the next target. Ultimately, the only cure for JMML is a bone marrow transplant, in
  addition to extensive chemotherapy over the coming months until we
  find the appropriate donor match. If you want to see if
  you would be a match for James, please register at the website below. Nearly 5,000 kids will be diagnosed with Leukemia this year. There are a lot of kids like James out there whose only hope is
  to find a good donor match. You can do it from your own
  home and it’s as easy as swabbing the inside of your cheek. Please visit: http://www.bethematch.org/ You can learn more about JMML at: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_myelomonocytic_leukemia Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers.  He’s the
  sweetest little boy you’ll ever meet. We can’t wait to
  hear his voice again. To see his kind blue eyes. To have him blow us a kiss with a smile. I love
    you James. You can donate to James’ care at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/f1OA33/pay",https://fundrazr.com/f1OA33

"10,660",Stan Romanek Medical /Life FundRazer,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,144,"I'm adding the story behind this fund raiser so you may
    understand who, what, when, where and most importantly why. Who: Stan Romanek is an ordinary man who experiences
    Extraordinary events. Stan is an innocent individual who has been
    convicted of a horrendous crime. A crime against children. Stan
    maintains his innocence, and his friends and family stand by his
    side knowing he would never harm a child, not even by looking at
    pictures of abuse by others. Stan is a father,stepfather, step-Papa, husband, brother, son,
    friend and a lifeline of understanding & support to many people
    around the world. What: It all began in Dec. 2000 when Stan witnessed and
    documented his first UFO. His experiences of contact with ETs/UFO's
    still continues just not as often. More....What: Over the past 17 years Stan has endured threats,
    physical assaults, being shot at, called a fraud and worse. Stan has also received love, praise, thanks, respect, from
    around the world, and according to some a little fame. Netflix
    movie, EXTRAORDINARY:The Stan Romanek Story is a documentary about
    his life and experiences. In 2013 A detective named Koopman arrived at Stan's home with
    a search warrant, an armed SWAT Team, and 2 persons from a forensics
    lab. The team spent 2 1/2 hours in his home, searching. They found
    no evidence of what they were searching for. ( What...Child Porn) No
    disk, no jump drive, no picture, or any trace on any computer!!!! When: April 2013...search warrant When: February 2014 Stan was arrested. He spent 12 hours in
    jail. That's how long it takes to bail someone out. When: 4 1/2 years after the search warrant, August 2017 Stan
    was found guilty of possesion of CP by a 12 member jury. Stan does not blame the jury. They weren't give all of the
    evidence in this case. They weren't allowed to know that Det.
    Koopman had faced his own felony charges in 2016 for basically lying
    to a judge in a murder case pre-trial. He was found not guilty.
    However, the detective was placed on a Brady list. A list for police
    officers who lie in their official capacity. No one could tell the jury about this in Stan's trial, they
    didn't know of the other cases the Det. lied in or that there were 2
    civil lawsuits against the detective. A lot of evidence and witnesses provided for Stan's defense
    was not allowed or were limited in what they could say. This is not how the justice system us supposed to work.
    Innocent people found guilty and guilty people found innocent???? Where: Loveland Colorado, Larimer County. Why: WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO STAN?? The reason is simple. Silence the messenger! Our therory is that the evidence found 10 months after the
    search warrant was planted. The evidence proves our therory!!!
    Evidence not seen by the jury! How: Malicious activity!!! Virus with backdoor access, a bad
    cop, a dark agency bent on silencing Stan, someone who simply didn't
    agree with Stan's message of the ET/UFO reality????? Who knows!?! The end of this Story is still to be written. On October 19, 2017 Stan will appear in court for sentencing. Nothing can change that fact. The judge is a good judge, and
    Stan's fate is in her hands. What can be done to finish this Story? Please share this
    fundraiser. Donate whatever amount you can, and assist Stan in
    getting an appeal. Justice for Stan is our mission. Do you Stand with Stan? #IStandWithStan PAYPAL Donations: lisaromanek@yahoo.com Thank you, blessings, love and gratitude to you all!",https://fundrazr.com/d1HMsc

  aniah who is my everything. I am starting this campaign in the hopes of raising funds to get the
  surgery that I so desperately need to live a normal life again. I was diagnosed with subcapsular cataracts in both eyes that is
  taking away my vision and in my case, my vision is deteriorating
  pretty quick. this particular cataract can mature in years months or
  even weeks. It seems that some of the asthma medications I have been taking for
  years ADVAIR to help me breath contained steroids that years later
  would change my way of life in a way that I would have never imagined.
  you know your in deep trouble when you can't see your own face in the
  mirror anymore. At 52 I was just enjoying my 3-year-old grandbaby and watching her
  grow up and looking forward to seeing her attend the 1st day of school
  and school plays and just being her protector and best friend. without
  this surgery, I will not see her grow up and do those little things
  that mean so much. This surgery is very expensive 3500 per eye and I don't have the cash
  or the insurance to cover this surgery on my own so the only way I can
  restore my vision and have a normal life again is to ask for help.
  your small donation can help me get closer to getting the surgery I need. My situation is urgent that's why I am reaching out to family and
  friends to donate. my ability to focus is gone already. all I see is
  shapes bright light and lots of fog and it's so scary. I don't leave
  the house anymore the sun makes it worst and my hobbies of producing
  music and gaming are sadly over for me at this point. I can't read
  anything unless its a few inches in front of me and only out my right
  eye. my left eye no matter how close I can't read out of it.
  depression has also kicked in but trying to stay strong. the only
  relief I get is when I close my eyes to sleep. if I can get only one
  eye done I would be the happiest person in the world but the goal here
  is to get both done. I hope that you can find it in your heart to donate to my campaign so
  I can see faces vivid colors and blue skies again. most importantly I
  would be able to see my granddaughters face again. thank you god bless

"8,658",Zach Branson's Medical Fundraiser,U.S. Dollar,"Jan 2, 2020",of $50k goal,66,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for
  disability. The application status is pending. We are asking to share
  this page with everyone you know. Encourage your loved ones and
  friends to become an organ and tissue donor. If you have been blessed
  enough in life to allow yourself to make a donation to this brave,
  strong young man it is greatly appreciated. All funds raised will be

      years and four months ago my life’s journey took a sharp turn.
      With no real warning the ‘C’ word entered my world like a tidal
      wave. Over the next two months I endured test after test and scan
      after scan to determine just what I was dealing with and how to
      treat it. We prayed, we wept, we yelled, we sat quiet, we
      questioned, we doubted, we fought. Against the grain and advice of
      many, I chose non-traditional treatment. This was a life-changing
      decision. My entire lifestyle was to be changed; eating, resting,
      processing. It was a very difficult time for me, making all the
      changes necessary for my health and then having things change due
      to my choice. Changing my diet and learning my new way of eating
      was super tough; saying no to things giving myself more time for
      rest and healing was super tough; navigating work, loss of work,
      relationships and loss of relationships was super tough; but I did it. I am now faced with a not so new challenge...my cancer is
        back. I have spent the last month enduring labs, tests and scans
        to figure out what we are dealing with now. We have consulted
        with doctors from both sides of the treatment world. It has been
        a long, overwhelming process, but we have made a decision. So I
        will be heading to Germany for treatment. My Rick will be with
        me the first two weeks of what will be approximately six weeks
        of intense treatment. This leaves our precious girls here with
        Grandma and Grandpa for that time and a huge support group of
        friends to bridge the gaps! I covet your prayers as I begin this
        treatment. Protection of my girls, wisdom and patience for my
        husband, strength and peace for my mom, travel mercies,
        successful treatment, eradicating the cancer are just a few of
        the prayer requests I would ask of you. Thank you in advance for
        joining me in prayer. It is our most powerful weapon against the darkness. Psalm 46:1-7 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.[c] 4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells. 5 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day. 6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. 7 The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.

"14,300",Help Zuberi Walk Again With Stem Cell Treatment                in 2019!!!,U.S. Dollar,,of $85k goal,5,"https://youtu.be/qAHDUtt8YAA In 1993 in Oakland, CA at age 23, Zuberi Mwanathaura became the
  unintentional target in a gun shooting. In the aftermath that
  followed, he was ultimately rendered paralyzed from the chest down and
  wheelchair bound. The shooter’s bullet was meant for his cousin, but
  he was caught in the crossfire, an irony, since he had lived as a law
  abiding citizen his entire life; making his goal to stay clear of
  drugs and violence, unfortunately it became his nemesis. Zuberi lived a very positive and active life before, which he still
  maintains since the tragedy. Albeit, he grew up in the inner city and
  managed to avoid major incidents of violence involving guns, drugs and
  gangs. He knew it was incumbent to remain focused on his goals of
  living a very disciplined life by never drinking alcohol or using any
  kind of drugs, thus avoiding conduits possibly predisposing themselves
  such a tragic outcome. Zuberi at the very time of the shooting worked
  three jobs, seven days a week, while raising two children along with
  pursuing his goals and dreams of being an entertainer (actor, model,
  dancer, rapper and writer). Post the immediacy of the incident, he has
  survived two life threatening surgeries with his heart stopping twice
  on the operating table. Afterwards, and as he convalesced, while
  bedridden for a year, with countless prayers, tears, family and
  community support, he regained physical strength and emotional
  resiliency (although punctuated by intense, constant, and chronic pain
  related to the remaining bullet fragments in his spinal cord and
  chest; 25 years post-incident, he continues to endure the never-ending
  constant, excruciating, chronic, physical pain induced by the bullet
  fragments that remained in his spine). Once stabilization period peaked Zuberi began volunteering by
  mentoring to youth, doing motivational speaking engagements, at
  numerous schools, churches, and social programs; ALL at his own
  expense never charging a fee for his services! Desirous of furthering
  his formal education, Zuberi went back to school and began to
  matriculate his degree and in May, 2000 he was conferred with a
  Bachelor of Arts degree in History Education from Clark Atlanta
  University in Atlanta, Georgia. Currently Zuberi has a T4 Spinal Cord injury, as well as bone on bone
  cartilage wrist damage, as a result of 25 years of confinement in his
  wheelchair and years of operating his wheelchair manually. His
  recommended treatment for his condition is Stem Cell Treatment and
  Rehabilitation. He is requesting this project be funded As Soon As
  Possible in order for him to benefit from this crucial and essential
  surgery. In addition, he is a prolific writer and film producer with
  an ultimate goal to complete his book and documentary projects titled,
  “Dreaming Beyond My Circumstances”; highlighting  his “ tragedy to
  triumph” story to encourage others that no matter what their adversity
  in life or circumstances they live with, to never give up. Zuberi
  hopes to exemplify that you can still make it no matter your
  circumstances. He wants to shout from the mountaintops, “Just don’t
  give up on your dreams, goals and aspirations, and NEVER give up the
  fight!” His ultimate goal is to walk, dance and run again through this
  vital Stem Cell Treatment. On behalf of Zuberi Mwanathaura, we wish to Thank You in advance for
  your prayers, your financial support, your love and sharing his story
  through social media, and with your friends & families. Please join us in our campaign to Help Zuberi Walk Again in 2019!! Speech in link below of Zuberi doing a Motivational Speech to High

255,Help My Mom Kick Cancer!,U.S. Dollar,,of $50k goal,6,"Hello, everyone. For those of you that don't know me, my name is
  Amelia Myers. I am a newlywed living in Japan and teaching
  internationally with my husband. I received a phone call the other day
  with possibly the worst news my mind could have imagined. My mother has breast cancer. It was a surreal moment for me. I had never felt so trapped and
  helpless. I honestly thought myself and my family were invincible to
  tragedy like this, but this was not the case. Thankfully, they seem to
  have caught it before it spreads too far, but it will be a long and
  painful battle to prevent any further issues from occurring. She has
  many more appointments to make, future surgeries, future treatments...
  We are not even sure what the botched insurance policies will even do
  at this point. I am trying to do everything I can from abroad to help, but
  unfortunately I have little to no options other than wait, hope, and
  pray. My husband, Jason, and I are planning on returning to the States
  as soon as we can for a visit, but it will take us some time to raise
  enough money to do so. Jason and I didn't get to have a proper wedding
  ceremony due to our quick move abroad (and the funds required for
  moving), so we were planning on returning to have a vow renewal and
  reception party so that our parents could attend. That is even more crucially important to me now. I want my mother to be able to see me in a wedding dress. I want
  my parents to be able to afford to retire and live comfortably, and
  maybe pay us a visit as well once in a while. I want my mother to be
  able to afford her treatment. I want to see my mother kick this and get better. And I need
  your help to do that. Please, consider donating any small amount (even $1 will matter
  in the long run). Every dollar donated will go straight to paying for
  her treatments and medical costs. If there are any extra funds after
  the fundraiser is over, I will personally be donating them to the
  Breast Cancer Research Foundation to help future cases like my
  mother's. Even just sharing this fundraiser would mean the world to my
  family and I. Thank you. --- I will list below the current charges for my mother's medical
  treatments. I will update as we get more information. Breast Imaging Diagnostic Bilateral Visit -

  his experimental therapy treatment. Adaś Skrzypek  was born just
  before Christmas with the worst type of SMA, type 1. His parents were
  told that he would not reach his first birthday. The doctors informed
  them that there is no cure for SMA at the moment and all they could do
  was to wait for the worst, while his muscles slowly withered away
  until his respiratory system failed and cause Adaś to suffocate. But,
  despite terrifying diagnosis, Aneta and Tomasz Skrzypek, Adaś’s
  parents didn’t give up. They started a daily rehabilitation regime for
  Adaś and started searching around the world for a cure. Adaś's
  condition deteriorated quickly which meant he was no longer offered
  experimental therapies in Europe. He was now not able to swallow or
  breathe properly and was fitted with a tracheotomy tube. Adaś nearly
  died several times but he is a little fighter and was able to start an
  experimental therapy which his parents had found. They didn’t give up
  after being refused help in Europe and they searched around the world
  finally coming across a new treatment in America. The therapy involves
  an injection every 45 days and oral medications in between. Adaś was
  given the first injection just before he turned 6 months old. And a
  tiny mirracle had happened!! Adaś was able to breathe for 20 minutes
  all by himself for the first time in a very long time. He was also
  able to slightly move his head and suck a dummy. There is a realistic
  chance that the experimental therapy that Adaś is receiving will be
  successfull. But unfortunately the cost of the treatment have exceeded
  his parents financial capabilities. The cost of it is 80000 polish
  zlotych (£15,000) every 45 days, and this sum will increase once the
  doses get stronger. By helping Adaś, we are helping children around the world who have
  been or may be born with incurable SMA. We can make a difference and
  change the world. We are giving hope to all the parents who were told
  that the only thing they could do was to give up and wait for the
  worst. Please help by donating any amount in polish zlotych (PLN) or
  the equivalent in another currency and sharing it on Facebook. We can
  spread the word and be a part of something amazing!! We can save

  szkieletowych, a w ciężkich przypadkach prowadząca do śmierci. Typ 1,
  wczesnodziecięcy jest najpoważniejszy. Objawy choroby pojawiają sie
  zaraz po urodzeniu lub do szóstego miesiąca życia. Dziecko rzadko ma
  szansę przeżycia dwóch lat. 1 na 5000 dzieci na świecie rodzi sie z SMA. Adaś Skrzypek jest malutkim chłopczykiem, który urodził się 20
  grudnia 2015 roku w Tarnowie. Adaś jest chory na SMA typ 1. Jego
  rodzice, Aneta i Tomasz Skrzypek, przed Wigilią dowiedzieli się, że
  ich długo wyczekiwany synek może nie doczekać swoich pierwszych
  urodzin. Lekarze nie dawali Adasiowi żadnych szans. Jedyne co Państwo
  Skrzypek mogli zrobić, to poddać się i czekać, aż mięśnie Adasia
  zwiotczeją, a uklad oddechowy przestanie działać i Adaś sie udusi.
  Jednak rodzice Adasia z pełną determinacją podjęli poszukiwania
  eksperymentalnej terapii w Europie, która dałaby szansę Adasiowi.
  Niestety po początkowym zakwalifikowaniu Adasia do jednej z terapii,
  stan chłopca pogorszył sie na tyle, że odmówiono jego leczenia. Adaś
  był kilka razy bliski śmierci, ale jest malutkim wojownikiem i przeżył
  po to, by móc wziąść udział w eksperymentalnej terapii, którą znaleźli
  jego rodzice. Nie poddali sie kiedy odmówiono Adasiowi leczenia w
  Europie i rozpoczęli poszukiwania na szeroką skalę na całym świecie,
  aby wreszcie znaleźć nadzieję w Ameryce. Chłopczykowi zaproponowano
  terapię w trakcie, której co 45 dni dostaje zastrzyk, a w między
  czasie przyjmuje leki doustne. Adaś pierwszy zastrzyk dostał niedługo
  przed swoim 6 miesiącem życia. I stał sie maleńki cud!! Adaś był w
  stanie samodzielnie oddychać przez 20 minut, czego nie mógł robić już
  od długiego czasu. Mógł również lekko poruszać główką i trzymać
  smoczek w buźce. Nie mógł tego robić od wielu tygodni. Jest realna
  szansa, że ta eksperymentalna terapia, której Adaś jest poddawany,
  będzie zakończona sukcesem. Niestety, koszt terapii przerósł
  możliwości finansowe rodziców Adasia. Jej koszt, to 80 tysięcy złotych
  co 45 dni. Może to ulec zwiększeniu, kiedy dozy staną się mocniejsze.
  Pomagając Adasiowi, pomagamy dzieciom na całym świecie, które już są
  lub urodzą się chore na nieuleczalną chorobę rdzeniowego zaniku mięśni
  (SMA). Możemy zmienić ich świat i dać nadzieję rodzicom, którym
  powiedziano, że jedyną rzeczą, którą mogą zrobić, to poddać się i
  czekać na najgorsze. Proszę, pomóżcie Adasiowi wpłacając datki w

"18,845",Support for Treva - Breast Cancer Journey - Part III,,,,,"The post below is from Treva's blog, OneGoodBoob ,  where she chronicles her breast
  cancer journey that started way back in 2005. She
  hoped that new posts wouldn't be necessary.  But unfortunately, she
  received some bad news.  Breast cancer.  Again.  For the third time.
   I'll borrow the title from one of her early posts... ""Ain't That Some Shit!"" If you're reading this, you know Treva's personality and can hear her
  voice and brutal honest truth in those words.  You also know her
  strength - her ability to fight endlessly and to also be there for
  every single person when they need her. The financial burden of cancer is beyond tremendous.  It's hard
  enough to go through treatment and all that comes with it.  We want
  for Treva, Marshall and Bella to not feel the strain of medical bills.
   We want for their lives to continue as normally as possible during
  this time.  Would you help make this possible? Hundreds and hundreds of people love Treva and her beautiful
  family. Please share so that we can reach everyone who cares and wants
  to help. We love you Treva!!! http://www.onegoodboob.wordpress.com/2018/10/09/being-water/ Be water. Whatever forms of water this journey of life requires of you A stream, a drip, a tsunami, a gentle rain or maybe the waves of the oceans For water always finds a way September 7th was not a good day.  The week had been a cluster of
  tests and biopsies.  Once again, for the third time, I was told that I
  had cancer.  I was somewhat surprised by my reaction.  If you have
  read my prior blog posts, you know that I always felt that I was
  “running from the monster”.  Maybe I knew that he would one day catch
  me again.  Whatever the reason, I remained eerily calm in the face of
  this storm.  This time it is in the other breast, the “one good boob”. Life has thrown me many curve balls, as it does with us all.  I
  decided this time not to waste energy on being angry or super sad.  I
  am facing this fight focused and confident.  I am going into this
  battle as a seasoned warrior.  I will not lose.  I will beat it
  again.  I will be here for my daughter, my husband, my family and my friends.",https://fundrazr.com/forourfriendtreva

      more pair of these babies! I got my first pair of enchromas for
      outdoors and ordered them in a hurry/ out of disbelief that they

      anything helps WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions",https://fundrazr.com/b1Tgq4
"3,320",Team Incredible: Funds for Hadera's Bone Marrow Transplant,U.S. Dollar,"Jul 1, 2019",of $12k goal,31,"Please let me introduce you to Hadera.  He is a creative sketch
  artist, a cellist, an ROTC marine (in training), a big brother,
  younger brother, and a young man of faith.  He is my son and his life
  is precious to me and everyone in his family.  He was born fourteen
  years ago with Sickle Cell Disease. As a mother, I was devistated. The prognosis was not good.  I had a
  difficult time thinking about his future. But, over time, I learned
  how to care for him and that with appropriate medical care, he could
  have a future.  As he grew, my focus became how to teach him to care
  for himself and manage his illness as an adult. During one of his clinic visits, the doctor discussed the possibility
  of a bone marrow transplant for Hadera.  I had read about them but the
  idea of him receiving bone marrow from a stranger had risks and I
  wasn't comfortable with them.  Time passed.  I had another baby (after
  ten years), a healthy baby girl - no Sickle Cell Trait or Disease. 
  Nothing!  Again, during a routine clinic visit, the doctor brought up
  the idea of a bone marrow transplant for Hadera. He thought that
  Hadera was a good candidate.  He suggested that each member of the
  immediate family be tested to determine if anyone could be a bone
  marrow donor.  Although the chances were low, we decided to have the
  tests done.  The best case scenario was that a direct sibling would be
  a 100% match. I wasn't very hopeful. I only had two other children and
  his father and I were not good candidates.  The testing was done at
  low resolution.  Within a few weeks, I received a call from the bone
  marrow clinic at Texas children's Hospital.  The nurse told me that
  there was a possible match in the family....Who was it?  It was his
  three year old sister!  I refused to get too excited.  We took her in
  for a high resolution test and within a few weeks, it was confirmed
  that she was a 100% bone marrow match.  Now what?  Well, tests were
  done, their weights were taken and it was determined that she was just
  too small to undergo such a procedure at that time.  So we would wait. A few months ago, the doctors announced that my daughter had gained
  enough weight and that we could now prepare for the transplant to take
  place in February.  Things began to happen quickly now.  Since the
  process includes chemotherapy, there was a risk of damage to his
  reproductive organs.  So we attempted sperm banking (It is
  inconclusive as to whether or not that will be useful or not at this
  time).  In addition, it was determined that if he and his sister had
  the same blood type, more of the stem cells from the bone marrow could
  be preserved (or rather nothing lost).  Therefore, they their blood
  was tested and (low and behold) they are the same blood type! A few weeks before the transplant, I finally had to explain to my
  little four year old what she was about to do.  So I asked her,
  ""Do you know why your brother is in the hospital?"" and she
  answered, ""Yes because his blood is sick."" So I went on to
  tell her that she had superhero blood and then asked if she would
  please let him have a little of it.  After she thought for a few
  seconds, she said, ""okay.""  Around that time, she kept
  asking for the Jack Jack doll from the recent Incredibles movie. So it was bought for her.  That
  got me thinking about how incredible our story was .... she was.
  Incredible.... yes like the movie! A few days before the transplant,
  she requested the Incredibles costume (of course).  So I quickly
  purchased it and she would wear it on the day of the surgery. From
  that day on, we became Team Incredible. On February 9th, Hadera was admitted to Texas Children's Hospital BMT
  unit to begin chemotherapy that would destroy his diseased bone
  marrow.  He tolerated the process well with few side effects.  The
  following Wednesday, February 20th, his four year old sister was
  brought in to the hospital to have her bone marrow stem cells
  harvested. My prayer was that the doctors would be able to harvest
  more that what they needed, so that a less desirable ""Plan
  B"" would not be needed.  After the surgery, the cells were
  processed and counted, and; it was determined that they had collected
  an excess of the cells that they had expected.  I almost cried right
  there in the hall as the doctors made their monumentous announcement. 
  That same evening, the precious stem cells were transplanted into him
  while we all sat and watched. Although the transplant is complete,  the important waiting process
  has begun.  The new stem cells must engraft into Hadera's body and
  become his own.  Until then, he has no functioning immune system and
  is extremely vulnerable to infection and disease.  Until engraftment
  is complete, he must remain in Texas Children's Hospital for at least
  three to four more weeks. After that, he will be quarantined at home
  for several months to allow his new bone marrow to grow and immune
  system to develop.  The success rate for this treatment is above
  ninety percent which gives us reason to celebrate. Bone marrow transplant is extremely expensive and will cost thousands
  of dollars. Therefore, we are hoping that this cause will resonate
  with you.  Thank you for supporting Team Incredible.",https://fundrazr.com/51SuHa
